You will require your Steem _PRIVATE POSTING KEY_ for this plugin to work. Your _PRIVATE POSTING KEY_ is <strong>NOT</strong> stored on our servers.

The plugin will automatically get a 15% curation reward from the Steem post created with this plugin for the use of development and maintenance cost with the beneficiary going to @steemful. (This is the brand I created for my projects related to Steem blockchain)
