== Description ==

= What is Steem? =
[Steem](https://steem.io/) is a blockchain-based social media platform where anyone can earn rewards. An example platform built on top of Steem block chain is [Steemit](steemit.com/).

= What is Cryptocurrency? =
A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency)

= Note =
You will require your Steem _PRIVATE POSTING KEY_ for this plugin to work. Your _PRIVATE POSTING KEY_ is <strong>NOT</strong> stored on our servers.

The plugin will automatically get a 15% curation reward from the Steem post created with this plugin for the use of development and maintenance cost with the beneficiary going to @steemful. (This is the brand I created for my projects related to Steem blockchain)

= Limitations =
- No support yet for scheduled posts but it will be supported on upcoming releases.
- Conversion of post content to Markdown may be off sometimes.

= Support =
Please support me by following me on Steem [@recrypto](https://steemit.com/@recrypto) or if you feel like donating, that would really help a lot on my future Steem developments around WordPress ecosystem. :)


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WordPress Steem, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "WordPress Steem" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get support or talk to other users? =
